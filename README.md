I reviewed and worked with the 6 sections provided by Prof. Warrick as reference material. Unfortunately, I found the material to be more confusing than helpful, and was written, to me, for students with much more JS experience than what we have had (especially considering I've done extremely well in all of the other coding classes). Unlike the other coding classes, the reference material didn't line-up or was intuitive to follow and utilize for the assignment. This made the assignment extremely frustrating & stressful and not useful. So, I ended up using: 

- LinkedIn Learning: Essential JavaScript
- The JavaScript book Prof. Vasquez assigned in Web Principles "JavaScript & JQuery" by Jon Duckett
- www.w3schools.com
- A few YouTube tutorials

While these did help, unfortunately, I couldn't find the solution for multiplying the toppings in the if/else statement. Very disappointing and not a great learning experience.
